Welcome! Iâ€™m a compassionate and experienced **Registered Psychotherapist (Qualifying)** with a diverse background spanning private practice, residential treatment, and the non-profit community sector.

With over **five years of clinical experience**, I work with teens and adults navigating:

- Mental health challenges  
- Trauma and PTSD  
- Addiction and recovery  
- Relationship struggles  
- Personal growth and self-confidence

My therapeutic style is **integrative**, drawing from evidence-based approaches including:

- Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)  
- Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)  
- Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)  
- Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT)  
- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

At the core of my practice is a **person-centered philosophy**. I strive to create a **warm, collaborative space** where you feel safe to explore your thoughts, emotions, and behaviours. I'm here to support your journey with compassion, clarity, and practical tools for lasting change.
